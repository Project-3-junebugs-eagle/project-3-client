# Cinebuster

Our idea behind Cinebuster was to recreate our own version of what Blockbuster could have become if they had adapted to E-commerce and didn't go out of business. Our application allows unregistered users to view our movie catalog, which includes a picture, title and description of the movie.

If the user decides they want to join our site, they can do so by signing up (returning users have the option of signing in, of course). Once signed in, users can change their password or sign out whenever they want.

Registered users can see see the price of each movie and add them to their cart. Users can also see the total amount of the movies and 'purchase' them from their cart. After purchasing, users can click on 'My purchases' to see the movies they have bought. 

After 'buying' a movie, users can get a refund for it. They can also write a review for each movie they've bought.

## User stories

1. As a user, I would like to be able to sign in if I have an account or sign up if I don't.
   
2. As a signed in user, I would like to be able to  change my password.

3. As a signed in user, I would like to sign out.
   
4. As a unregistered user, I would like to see all the products (movies).

5. As a signed in user, I would like to be able to see the price of the products.
   
6. As an authenticated user, I would like to add and remove products from a shopping cart.
   
7. As a registered user, I would like to see the total of the products in my cart before purchasing.
   
8. As an authenticated user, I would like to purchase products in a shopping cart using Stripe.
   
9.  As a user, I would like to get a refund for the products after purchasing them.

10. As a user, I would like to write a review for each movie.
    
11. As a signed in user, I would like to see my past orders.
   
#### Stretch Goals

1. As a user I would like to be able to search products by name.
2. As a user, I can rate a title in the store and it goes towards an averaged rating
   
### Problems to be solved in future iterations
1. Movie pictures are only being displayed in 'Home'. For future iterations, we want to display the pictures in the cart and 'My purchases' so users can see them there as well.
2. Fix the positioning of the buttons and price in the movie cards.
3. Center the 'Pay with card' button in 'My cart' and change the color/styling so it looks like the other ones.
4. Make color scheme more uniform.

### Planning, process, problem solving

[Daily Stand Up Plan](https://imgur.com/h1GQx9o)

As a team, we planned what our project would be by brainstorming our individual ideas until we made a decision. Once we had the general idea of what we wanted to do, we created our user stories, wireframe and ERD. 

The next step in our planning process was to create a suggested schedule that we could reference once we started. We also decided to have two daily stand ups where we talked about the things we had accomplished, the things we were planning to work on and any impediments we might be facing.

Since we were a team of 3, we decided that it would be beneficial to do mob programming, so we took turns sharing our screens and talked through problems as a team to get our features done.
